//! @brief Definition of RcclInternalAllReduce
//! We split source and destination buffer into n chunks where n is number of
//! gpus. Then, we assign each chunk to each gpu depending on the rank. For
//! example, all-reduce (sum) operation is requested on a 1024 float buffer
//! across 4 gpus, now each gpu operates on (1024/4 = 256) elements. Gpu 2
//! operates on buffer from index 512 to 767. Each gathers data from all the
//! gpus into its registers and does reduction operation on them. Using the
//! above example, gpu 2 gather data from index 512 to 767 from all the gpus
//! into its registers and does floating point addition on them. The final
//! result is stored into local destination buffer. Then, each gpu gathers rest
//! of the data from other gpus.
